          as singles. Both did well; they built on the success \
          of Hold It Now, Hit It. By early February 1987, \
          the LP had gone platinum. DJ Run had been proven correct. This seemed incredibly fast; \
          we were barely out of high school. Being small-time celebrities in our little NYC nightclub world\
           had been fun; getting a chance to make records was incredible.","Tyler, The Creator is making \
           a limited edition release of ice cream. The flavor is called Snowflake,\
            and will consist of cool peppermint, warm spearmint, a dash of sea salt, crunchy white chocolate\
             flakes, and white chocolate melted within the scoops. Tyler said: \
             For as long as I can remember, mint ice cream seemed to always come with every chocolate chip but white. \
             I finally got the two away from their clingy friends and set up a play date for my mouth.","Around \
             1981 they had begun producing home-made movies on Super-8 cine film, \
             and were creating the filmsâ€™ soundtracks themselves. By 1984, aged thirteen, Mike was already \
             visiting a local recording studio and making rough demos. Mike and Marcus were by now producing \
             more structured songs with any instruments they could lay their hands on, as well as completely \
             abstract tape collages of found sounds from radio and TV.","Unrewarding day-jobs funded the \
             purchase of audio gear and a variety of exotic acoustic musical instruments, and with the \
             acquisition of samplers the band began producing do-it-yourself garage demos on their own \
             label Music70 which they distributed mainly amongst friends. Soon the band was producing \
             cassette EP's and even entire albums of demo material, some of which have since gone on to \
             become legendary collectors' items.","His tracks blend fractured breakbeats with mysterious, \
             pitch-shifted voices and loads of vinyl crackle, rainfall, and submerged video game sound effects, \
             creating gloomy, dystopian soundscapes evoking lonely nights spent wandering around an empty, \
             desolate city. Not only was it one of the most widely praised albums of the year, but its influence \
             endured throughout the following decade, with countless producers emulating its vocal manipulations\
              and dramatic, rain-soaked atmospherics.");
